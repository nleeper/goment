# Goment
###### Current Version: 1.4.2
###### [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

Goment is a port of the popular Javascript datetime library [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/). It follows the Moment.js API closely, with some changes to make it more Go-like (e.g. using nanoseconds instead of milliseconds). 

Goment is still a work in progress. Please feel free to fork and contribute missing methods, locale/languages functionality, or just provide more idiomatic Go if you see some areas to improve. I have a list of things that need added/fixed in [TODO.md](TODO.md), but will create issues for them at some point.

### Parsing
#### From now
Creates a Goment object for the current local time returned by time.Now().
```
goment.New()
```
#### From ISO 8601 string
Creates a Goment object by parsing the string as an ISO 8601 date time. The timezone will be UTC unless supplied in the string.
```
goment.New('2013-02-08 09:30:26')
```
#### From string + format
Creates a Goment object by parsing the string using the supplied format. The timezone will be the local timezone unless supplied in the string.

The parsing tokens are similar to the formatting tokens used in [Goment#Format](#format).

Goment's parser is strict, and defaults to being accurate over forgiving.

```

### Get+Set
#### Get
Get is a string getter using the supplied units.

##### Supported units
* y, year, years
* M, month, months
* D, date, dates
* h, hour, hours
* m, minute, minutes
* s, second, seconds
* ms, millisecond, milliseconds
* ns, nanosecond, nanoseconds

```
g.Get('hours') // 22
```
#### Nanosecond
Gets the nanoseconds of the Goment object.
```
g.Nanosecond() // 600
```
#### Millisecond
Gets the milliseconds of the Goment object.
```
g.Millisecond() // 330
```
#### Second
Gets the seconds of the Goment object.
```
g.Second() // 33
```
#### Minute
Gets the minutes of the Goment object.
```
g.Minute() // 45
```
#### Hour
Gets the hours of the Goment object.
```
g.Hour() // 22
```
#### Day of Month
Gets the day of the month of the Goment object.
```
g.Date() // 19
```
#### Day of Week
Gets the day of the week (Sunday = 0...) of the Goment object.
```
g.Day() // 2
```
#### Day of Week (Locale Aware)
Gets the day of the week according to the locale of the Goment object.
```
g.Weekday() // 3
```
#### ISO Day of Week
Gets the Goment object ISO day of the week with 1 being Monday and 7 being Sunday.
```
g.ISOWeekday() // 4
```
#### Day of Year
Gets the day of the year of the Goment object.
```
g.DayOfYear() // 100
```
#### Week of Year
Gets the localized week of the year for the Goment object.

The week of the year varies depending on which day is the first day of the week (Sunday, Monday, etc), and which week is the first week of the year.

For example, in the United States, Sunday is the first day of the week. The week with January 1st in it is the first week of the year.

In France, Monday is the first day of the week, and the week with January 4th is the first week of the year.

The output of `g.Week()` will depend on the locale for the Goment object.
```
g.Week() // 52
```
#### Week of Year (ISO)
Gets the ISO week of the year of the Goment object.
```
g.ISOWeek() // 6
```
#### Month
Gets the month (January = 1...) of the Goment object.
```
g.Month() // 2
```
#### Quarter
Gets the quarter (1 to 4) of the Goment object.
```
g.Quarter() // 1
```
#### Year
Gets the year of the Goment object.
```
g.Year() // 2013
```
#### Week Year
Gets the week-year according to the Goment object's locale.

Because the first day of the first week does not always fall on the first day of the year, sometimes the week-year will differ from the month year.

For example, in the US, the week that contains Jan 1 is always the first week. In the US, weeks also start on Sunday. If Jan 1 was a Monday, Dec 31 would belong to the same week as Jan 1, and thus the same week-year as Jan 1. Dec 30 would have a different week-year than Dec 31.
```
g.WeekYear() // 2012
```
#### Week Year (ISO)
Gets the ISO week-year of the Goment object.
```
g.ISOWeekYear() // 2013
```
#### Weeks In Year
Gets the number of weeks according to locale in the current Goment's year.
```
g.WeekYear() // 53
```
#### Weeks In Year (ISO)
Gets the number of weeks in the current Goment's year, according to ISO weeks.
```
g.ISOWeeksInYear() // 52
```

```
#### Set Day of Week
Sets the day of the week (Sunday = 0...) for the Goment object.
```
g.SetDay(1)

```
g.SetDay("lunes")
```
#### Set Day of Week (Locale Aware)

### i18n
Goment has support for internationalization. 

In addition to assigning a global locale, you can assign a locale to a specific Goment object.

\* Currently, only formatting functions like `Format`, `To`, `From`, `ToNow`, `FromNow` & `Calendar` use locales. Only English (United States) datetime formats are able to be parsed at this time.

#### Changing global locale
By default, Goment uses English (United States) locale strings. Changing the global locale does not affect existing Goment instances.
```
SetLocale("es")
```

#### Getting global locale
```
Locale() // es
```

#### Changing locale for Goment instance
```
g.SetLocale("fr")
```

#### Getting locale for Goment instance
```
g.Locale() // fr
```

#### Weekdays
Returns a list of weekdays in the current locale. If the parameter provided is a bool value of true,
the list returned will take the current locale's first day of week into consideration. If no true parameter
is provided, the first day will always be Sunday for the locale.
```
g.SetLocale("en")
g.Weekdays() // [ "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday" ]

g.SetLocale("es")
g.Weekdays(true) // ["lunes", "martes", "miércoles", "jueves", "viernes", "sábado", "domingo"]
g.Weekdays() // ["domingo", "lunes", "martes", "miércoles", "jueves", "viernes", "sábado"]
```
#### WeekdaysShort
Returns a list of abbreviated weekdays in the current locale. If the parameter provided is a bool value of true, the list returned will take the current locale's first day of week into consideration. If no true parameter is provided, the first day will always be Sunday for the locale.
```
g.SetLocale("en")
g.WeekdaysShort() // [ "Sun", "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri", "Sat" ]

g.SetLocale("es")
g.WeekdaysShort(true) // ["lun.", "mar.", "mié.", "jue.", "vie.", "sáb.", "dom."]
g.WeedaysShort() // ["dom.", "lun.", "mar.", "mié.", "jue.", "vie.", "sáb."]
```
#### WeekdaysMin
Returns a list of abbreviated weekdays in the current locale. If the parameter provided is a bool value of true, the list returned will take the current locale's first day of week into consideration. If no true parameter is provided, the first day will always be Sunday for the locale.
```
g.SetLocale("en")
g.WeekdaysMin() // [ "Su", "Mo", "Tu", "We", "Th", "Fr", "Sa" ]

g.SetLocale("es")
g.WeekdaysMin(true) // ["lu", "ma", "mi", "ju", "vi", "sá", "do"]
g.WeedaysMin() // ["do", "lu", "ma", "mi", "ju", "vi", "sá"]
```
#### WeekdayByNumber
Returns the weekday name by number in the current locale. If the first parameter is a bool value of true,
the name returned will take the current locale's first day of week into consideration. If no true parameter is provided, the first day will always be Sunday for the locale.
```
g.SetLocale("en")
g.WeekdayByNumber(0) // "Sunday"

#### Adding a new locale
To add a new locale, there are a few steps to follow. You must first add a new file in the `/locales` folder. This should be named the locale code, e.g. `fr.go`. Inside this file, you need to create a new `LocaleDetails` object and provide the required values for month names, weekday names, ordinal function, etc. Please use one of the existing locales for reference.

After you've created the locale file, add a line to `locale.go` in the `SupportedLocales` map. This should be a map from the locale code to an instance of the `LocaleDetails` object you created above.

Lastly, please add test cases to `locale_test.go` that test the different datetime formats, and the relative time formats.
